## Migration plan - GreenDoge Network (Testnet0)
Because of the suggestions of many people, We decided to migrate from [ChiaDoge](https://github.com/ChiaDoge/chiadoge-blockchain) to a more thoughtful [GreenDoge Blockchain](https://github.com/GreenDoge-Network/greendoge-blockchain). GreenDoge mainnet will be lauched only after fully preparing windows and ubuntu versions. And let the rewards obtained by ChiaDoge can be transferred to the GreenDoge mainnet.

**GreenDoge** is a modern community-centric green cryptocurrency based on a proof-of-space-and-time consensus algorithm. It is a community-supported fork of the [Chia Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) codebase.Cancel changes
