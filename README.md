GreenDoge is a modern community-centric green cryptocurrency based on a proof-of-space-and-time consensus algorithm. It is a community-supported fork of the [Chia Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) codebase. The pre-farm coins of GreenDoge are the same as Chia, but __the early block reward of GreenDoge is 50 times that of Chia. You can win more money today.__

* [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware
* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)
* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state
* Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases
* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)
* [Pooling protocol](https://www.chia.net/2020/11/10/pools-in-chia.html) (in development) that allows farmers to have control of making blocks
* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing
* A growing community of farmers and developers around the world

## Please be informed
1. GreenDoge is not yet available for trading.<br>
2. The default value of _mojo_per_chia=1000000000000 is too large. In order to avoid the problem of [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) that is difficult to deal with in the future, and to reward early community participants. The block reward of the main network has been confirmed as [the code](https://github.com/GreenDoge-Network/greendoge-blockchain/blob/main/greendoge/consensus/block_rewards.py).

## Migration plan
ChiaDoge is no longer maintained. Because of the suggestions of many people, We decided to migrate from [ChiaDoge](https://github.com/ChiaDoge/chiadoge-blockchain) to a more thoughtful [GreenDoge Blockchain](https://github.com/GreenDoge-Network/greendoge-blockchain). GreenDoge mainnet is online!!!
