GreenDoge: A new blockchain and smart transaction platform that is easier to use, more efficient, secure, and lower energy consumption. It is a community-supported fork of Chia blockchain. Safely use your Chia mnemonics and plots to mine Green Dogecoin without plotting. Here are some of the features and benefits:
* Support Chia OG and new portable NFT plots without new hardware and plotting
* Lower energy consumption when mining with Chia
* Reduce the pre-mine value by increasing the block rewards
* [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware
* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)
* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state
* Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases
* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)
* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing
* A growing community of farmers and developers around the world
