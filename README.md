# greendoge-testnet 
Because of the suggestions of many people, I decided to migrate from ChiaDoge to GreenDoge. GreenDoge will be released only after fully preparing all OS versions. And let the rewards obtained by ChiaDoge can be transferred to the GreenDoge Network.

**ChiaDoge** is a modern community-centric green cryptocurrency based on a proof-of-space-and-time consensus algorithm. It is a community-supported fork of the [Chia Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) codebase.

Block Reward: 100<br>
Pre-farm: 21,000,000 (Development and Promotion Fund)
